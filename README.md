# Win Shutter 
*by Mattia Baroni*

This script pings Google.com's DNS repeatedly until the ping fails. Once the ping fails, a 60-second timer will start. 

At the end of the timer, the Windows system will shut down.

If you wish to cancel the shutdown before the 60 seconds are up, open the command prompt and type "SHUTDOWN -A".
